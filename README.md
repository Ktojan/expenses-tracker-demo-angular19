# ExpensesTrackerDemoAngular19

This is my demo Angular project of expences-incomes tracker for a possible "Galaxy traveller" (thanks to Douglas Adams). Implemented in January 2025.

##  Business logic and tech task in brief:

- Angular latest version (19) and its features: signals, standalone components, zoneless
- User should be able to add\remove expenses and incomes, view balance and filter records.
- User can add records through a form: (Name, Amount, Category, Date)
- All data must be stored in localStorage so that records persist after a page reload.
- Readable and understandable names of variables, classes, functions and methods

Not required: responsive design/crossbrowser, performance, security, ARIA.
